# DSCLRCN
code for the DSCLRCN paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01708

Note: our network needs the pretrained [ResNet50](https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks) and placesCNN models. For the latter, we changed its layer names to avoid the conflict with the ResNet layers. You can downnload it with our trained DSCLRCN model from [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1sbejbIJIW3N0p4WkdIOG5lZ2c).
